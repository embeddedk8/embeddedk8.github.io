The ARM Cortex-M0 processor and Cortex-M0þ processors are both 32-bit processors.
Their internal registers in the register banks, data paths, and the bus interfaces are all 32
bit.

Both of them have a single main system bus interface, therefore they are considered as
Von Neumann bus architecture.

Processor pipeline
• The Cortex-M0 processor has a three-stage pipeline (fetch, decode, and execute)

Instruction set
• The instruction set is based on ThumbÒ Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Only a
subset of the Thumb ISA is used (56 of them). Most of the instructions are 16 bit in
size, only a few of them are 32 bit.

32-bit addressing supporting up to 4 GB of memory space

nterrupt Handling
• The processors include a built-in interrupt controller called the Nested Vectored Interrupt
Controller (NVIC). This unit handles interrupt prioritization and masking functions. It
supports up to 32 interrupt requests from various peripherals (chip design dependent), an
additional Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) input, and also support a number of system
exceptions.
• Each of the interrupts can be set to one of the four programmable priority levels. NMI
has a fixed priority level.

Low Power support
• Architecturally two sleep modes are defined as normal sleep and deep sleep.
