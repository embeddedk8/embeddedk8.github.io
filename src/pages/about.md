I'm Kate! I created this blog to have a personal space where I can share 
things related to my interests: embedded systems in general, operating systems, 
low level software and computer internals.

I believe that writing about stuff leads to better understanding of the topic and
encourages to fill the knowledge gaps. I also hope that you will find here something useful for you.

Some facts about me:
- I graduated in 2014 from Electronics Engineering,
- I work since 2013 as Embedded Software Engineer,
- I have worked on wide variety of products: automotive infotainment systems,
3G cellular base stations, smart home appliances and IoT security products.
