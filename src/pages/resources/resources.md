# Resources for learning Embedded Systems
This is my personal collection of resources that I find useful, insightful, or simply interesting while learning embedded systems.
It’s still small, but I’ll keep expanding it over time. 😄

🗂️ **Legend:** 📝 Short reads · 📖 Books · 🧩 Exercises · 🛠️ Tools · 🎬 Videos

📖 [Competitive Programmer’s Handbook, Antti Laaksonen](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)  
🧩 [Exercism](https://exercism.org) *My favorite platform for programming exercises across many languages, with free mentor reviews.*

**Assembly and reverse engineering**  
📝 [ARM Reverse Engineering Notes](https://github.com/microbuilder/armreveng/)  
📖 [Compiling to Assembly from Scratch, Vladimir Keleshev (ARM)](https://keleshev.com/compiling-to-assembly-from-scratch/)
