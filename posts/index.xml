    <title>Arduino Internals: building sketches with Arduino CLI</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="/arduino-ide-build-process/" rel="">previous post</a> we took a closer look at how the Arduino IDE builds sketches.</p>
<p>Arduino also offers another way to build projects — by using the <strong>Arduino Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong> directly.
Starting with Arduino IDE 2.0, the IDE actually uses <code>arduino-cli</code> under the hood the build process,
so working with the CLI directly simply removes one layer of abstraction
while following the exact same steps — but with better flexibility and possibilities.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Arduino is one of the most popular ways to start learning embedded systems. At the same time, you can find plenty of debates online
about whether Arduino is a good choice for that (like &ldquo;<em>Is there anything wrong with Arduino?</em>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<em>Why engineers hate Arduino?</em>&rdquo; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1bz55bj/is_there_anything_wrong_with_arduino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">[1]</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/evb5nu/why_engineers_hate_arduino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">[2]</a> ).</p>
<p>While the list of arguments from Arduino &ldquo;opponents&rdquo; is quite long — and some of their points are completely reasonable
— I want to prove that you can learn just as much with Arduino as with any other embedded platform,
as long as you avoid blindly relying on the Arduino API and stay curious to explore what’s happening under the hood.
That&rsquo;s why I am creating the Arduino Internals series.</p>
<p><strong>As a starting point, let’s take a closer look at what happens when you build a sketch in the Arduino IDE.</strong></p>]]></description>
