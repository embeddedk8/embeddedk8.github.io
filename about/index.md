# About me


# Hi, I’m Kate!

Welcome to my space, where I share my thoughts and notes on embedded systems programming — 
and everything loosely related to it.

Who am I? I accidentally entered the world of embedded systems back in 2013 while pursuing my Master's in Electronics.
But electronics (especially analog) was never my strongest point. 
I’m slightly better with digital electronics, though some might argue that digital isn’t "real" electronics... and they might be right 😄.

Today, I am basically the software developer who touches the hardware and after all these years I still want to know how it works.

When I’m not coding, I am:
- a passionate genealogist (my great-grandfather survived the Western Front, including Somme and Verdun),
- an avid book lover — I read constantly, and when I’m not reading, I’m probably staring at my bookshelf or fondling my books 😄,
- a runner wannabe. I really want to run. I just didn't start yet. But my father runs ultra-marathons at almost 70, so the bar is high!

I hope you find something useful here!
